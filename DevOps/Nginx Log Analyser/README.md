This project provides a simple and effective **Bash CLI tool** to analyze an NGINX access log file and generate key traffic statistics from it.

## Features

This tool reads an NGINX access log and outputs the following:

- ðŸ”¹ **Top 5 IP addresses** making the most requests
- ðŸ”¹ **Top 5 requested paths**
- ðŸ”¹ **Top 5 HTTP response status codes**
